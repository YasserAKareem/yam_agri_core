# Enterprise Value Map (Compass)

Source PDF: `docs/Enterprise-Value-Map.pdf`

## Purpose
This document is the **compass** for YAM Agri: whenever we design DocTypes, Workspaces, KPIs/KRIs, Reports, or automation, we align them back to this Value Map.

## How to use this compass
- Prefer reusing existing ERPNext/Frappe/Agriculture DocTypes and reports.
- Every KPI/KRI/Report **should** link to a Value Driver when known.
- It is OK for early MVP items to be **unlinked** (soft guidance), but we track the gap and close it iteratively.

## Value Drivers (to fill)
